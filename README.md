# Docusaurus 2

This directory is a brief example of a [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Docusaurus project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/docusaurus-2&template=docusaurus-2)

_Live Example: https://docusaurus-2-template.vercel.app_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Docusaurus on Vercel, you can use the [Docusaurus CLI](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation#scaffold-project-website) to initialize the project:

```shell
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

After that it becomes a matter of creative discretion. The tutorials are simple enough and the layout ihmo is excellent. What is next? Well for me I plan on creating a blog about my journeys through open-source software development. I as well plan on creating a website where I can show the world my many web3 projects. Best of luck and all - HashbrownKazang
